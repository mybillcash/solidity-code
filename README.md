DECENTRALIZED MICROTASK PLATFORM ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WITH ENCRYPTED USER TO USER MESSAGES.



 HOW IT WORKS
 
 
Users can register either as employers or as freelancers on Mybillcash platform. After the registration, employers can post new jobs on the platform by starting a new campaign through the employer section on the platform, after which the country of choice is chosen and the needed number of workers is specified, along with the amount to be paid for each task as well as every other job description. 
Mybillcash powerful matching engine matches the job with competent freelancers on the system who can easily get the job done. 
To guarantee fast and assured payment, the employer makes payment to the system upon posting of a job. 
With this, employees are paid upon delivery and approval of their performed task. 
To get a job on Mybillcash, freelancers just have to source for the job that suits them on the system, by heading to the job section. 
 This makes it easy to get jobs matching your experience and skill set. 
Once completed, the user submits the details of the work done, for verification by the employer. 
 Users can also generate or redeem vouchers on Mybillcash platform, through the account section where users with up to 5 XSB tokens can create a voucher, which is redeemable by the same or other users on the same section.  Once a user redeems a voucher code, the worth of the voucher is added immediately to the user's account in XSB token. 
Mybillcash also has an end-to-end encrypted messaging feature, which lets the employers and workers communicate easily and securely, without any interference.
